An average investor or fund is estimated to leave 10% to 30% of potential earnings on the table due to their inability to respond quickly to market sentiment. Furthermore, investors and analysts can reduce the time and costs associated with market research by 20% to 50% if they can monitor other investors' opinions in real-time.
